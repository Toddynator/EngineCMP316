# EngineCMP316

Current Idea is a Voxel Engine to support a space game with newtonian-style physics based movement and voxel destruction.
A key goal will be optimization of mesh calculation to support runtime remeshing.
Other capabilities being procedural generation of voxel meshes for asteroids (and potentially other structures such as space stations?)
